Salesforce Status Helper created by Drew Rutherford

Available on Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/salesforce-status-helper

Description:
Click your preferred Omni-Channel status. The chosen status will remain active until disabled. This is useful for when Omni-Channel disconnects you unexpectedly and without warning.

Every 15 seconds the extension will verify that you're still logged in with the selected status. If not, it will automatically sign you back in.

If the extension detects that you're 'On a Web Case' it will NOT change your status. You will have to manually change out of it first.

Troubleshooting:
If you open Web Developer Tools (F12) or "Settings > More Tools >  Web Developer Tools" you should see console messages every 15 seconds that indicates status health checks are occurring. This would only apply if you have Available or Backlog set.

Features to come... maybe:

- Dropdown menu to select on-queue and backlog hours so that Status Helper will automatically sign you in and out as needed.
