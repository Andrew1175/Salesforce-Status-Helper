Salesforce Status Helper
Created by Drew Rutherford

Available on Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/salesforce-status-helper

Click your preferred Omni-Channel status. The chosen status will remain active until disabled. This is useful for when Omni-Channel disconnects you unexpectedly and without warning.

Every 15 seconds the extension will verify that you're still logged in with the selected status. If not, it will automatically sign you back in.

Features to come... maybe:

- Dropdown menu to select on-queue and backlog hours so that Status Helper will automatically sign you in and out as needed.
