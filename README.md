Salesforce Status Helper
Created by Drew Rutherford

Click your preferred Omni-Channel status. The chosen status will remain active until disabled. This is useful for when Omni-Channel disconnects you unexpectedly and without warning.

Every 15 seconds the extension will verify that you're still logged in with the selected status. If not, it will automatically sign you back in.
